## Notes

This resource manages **role assignments** for a single user (identified by email) within your Qdrant Cloud account.

### Behavior

- **Create**: Assigns the listed `role_ids` to the user (resolved by email).  
- **Update**: Adds newly specified roles; does not revoke existing roles outside of Terraform’s management.  
- **Delete**: Revokes only the roles listed in this resource (unless `keep_on_destroy = true`).  
- **Import**: Not supported — reconciliation happens automatically during creation.

### Attributes

- `user_id` — Resolved unique identifier (UUID) for the specified user.  
- `role_ids` — Set of role IDs managed by this resource.  
- `keep_on_destroy` — Prevents revocation of managed roles during destroy (boolean).  

### Important Notes

- This resource is **non-authoritative** — it only manages the roles explicitly listed in `role_ids`.  
- The user must already exist in the account.  
- On destroy, roles in `role_ids` are revoked unless `keep_on_destroy` is set to `true`.
