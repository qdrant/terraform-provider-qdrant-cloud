## Import

`qdrant-cloud_accounts_role` can be imported using the role ID:

```bash
$ terraform import qdrant-cloud_accounts_role.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

## Notes

This resource manages **custom IAM Roles** within your Qdrant Cloud account.

### Role Behavior

- **Create**: Only roles of type `ROLE_TYPE_CUSTOM` can be created.  
- **Update**: Modifies existing role name, description, and permissions.  
- **Delete**: Removes the role entirely from your account.  
- **Import**: Imports an existing role into Terraform state.

### Permissions

Each role must include at least one permission block:

```hcl
permissions {
  value    = "read:backups"
  category = "Cluster"
}
```

Common permission categories include:

- `Identity And Access Management`
  - read:roles
  - write:roles
  - delete:roles
  - read:management_keys
  - write:management_keys
  - delete:management_keys
  - write:invites
  - read:invites
  - delete:invites
  - read:users
  - delete:users

- `Cluster`
  - read:api_keys
  - write:api_keys
  - delete:api_keys
  - read:backups
  - write:backups
  - delete:backups
  - restore:backups
  - read:clusters
  - write:clusters
  - delete:clusters
  - read:cluster_data
  - write:cluster_data
  - read:backup_schedules
  - write:backup_schedules
  - delete:backup_schedules

- `Hybrid Cloud`
  - read:hybrid_cloud_environments
  - write:hybrid_cloud_environments
  - delete:hybrid_cloud_environments

- `Payment`
  - read:payment_information
  - write:payment_information

- `Account`
  - read:account

Permissions are **unordered** and represented as a set in Terraform,  
so changes in order won’t trigger diffs.

### Read-only Attributes

The following attributes are computed after creation:
- `id` — Unique role identifier (UUID)
- `created_at` — Creation timestamp
- `last_modified_at` — Last modification timestamp
- `sub_type` — System subtype if applicable
